=== Introduction ===

This file intends to give a clear overview of the way QR-codes works. A
QR-code is basically a two-dimensional barcode. It is designed to be
easily recognised in a picture (typically shot from a mobile phone) and
to withstand against alterations (physical alteration of the support,
lens flare or recognition glitch).

Their main use is to allow an user to easily access a piece of
information on a physical object using computer-like device (well, a
mobile phone). For example, consumer products often contain an URL to
a promotionnal webpage. An URL could also link to a detailed pack of
information that would not fit on the physicial object.



=== QR-code appearance ===

A QR-code is a square grid block of "modules". A module is a white or
dark square block. They can be seen as individual pixels but will be
usually represented as several pixels on a picture. The "version" of a
QR-code is a number between 1 and 40 (included) which defines its size:
the number of modulus on the side of a version 'v' QR-code is 17+4*v.

Examples of QR-codes can be found in the 'examples/' directory. These
images have been generated using 'qrencode' version 4.3.2 available in
Debian repositories. It generates PNG files. However, the PBM file format
(1) is handier to parse. It is basically an ASCII grid of pixels. The
conversion from PNG to PBM has been done using 'convert' from the
ImageMagick software suite.

We will consider the 'hw.pbm' example which contains the single string
"Hello World!". The content of the file is:

The first line is information about the format (ASCII black/white
bitmap). The second line gives the width and height of the image. The size
of this QR-code is 21 so its version is 1. Replacing the 0s with spaces
and the 1s with Xs gets us a more readable representation of the QR-code:

=== Patterns ===

The first layer in the QR-code decoding stack is the shape recognition. It
is a difficult and error-prone task. To ease the process of this step,
regular fixed patterns are embedded within the image.

The finder patterns and the timing patterns are present in all regular
QR-codes; the number alignment patterns depends on the size of the
QR-code. The first two are present in Figure 1 and Figure 2 help to
locate them (the 0s which are part of the patterns have been put back).

== Finder patterns ==

The most obvious patterns are the "finder patterns". They are located
in the top-left, top-right and bottom-left corners. They are composed
of a 3x3 full square within a 7x7 empty square and are separated from
the remaining of the image by a 1-module wide white border.

As their name suggest, they are used to locate a QR-code within a bigger
image and to determine the orientation of the QR-code. Note that they
do not extend with the version/size of the QR-code (their size remain
of 7 modules).

== Timing patterns ==

The second kind of pattern is less outstanding: two lines of alternating
modules. One line is the seventh row and the other is the seventh column
(minus the finder patterns).

They help infering the size of the modules. In the example, they are
5-module long, but their length varies accordingly with the version/size
of the QR-code.

== Alignment patterns ==

There are no alignment patterns in the example. They are made of a dark
module within 5x5 empty square, without any border:

= Figure 3: Alignment pattern =
X X X X X
X 0 0 0 X
X 0 X 0 X
X 0 0 0 X
X X X X X
= End of Figure 3 =

They are used to help the shape-recognition software align the modulus
grid in bigger QR-codes. Their coordinates varies a bit accross the
QR-code versions and are given in tables.



=== Information ===

== Format information ==

Format information is 5-bit long. 10 more bits help correcting errors
that would happend in this section. These 15 bits are xor-masked with
101010000010010b before being put twice in the QR-code for redundancy.

In the example (see Figure 4), the 15-bit long masked format information
is 111110110101010b. It contains the 5 bits 11000b. The three first bits
110b pick the mask no 6 and the last two set the error correction level
to 0 (L).

== Version information ==

NOTE: the version information is only present from version 7 to 40

The version information is just the version of the QR-code. It is
directly encoded within the image to help the infering of the size of
the moduli. The version takes 6 bits, plus 12 error correction bits. No
masking is applied and the 18-bit long chain can be found in two locations
as shown in Figure 5 for a version 8 QR-code.

The previous figure shows a version information chain of
001000010110111100b (bottom-to-top, right-to-left), which corresponds
to the 6-bit number 001000b, for version 8, as expected.
